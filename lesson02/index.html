            <p>
                Fitt's law stats that the larger and object is the easier it is for the user to access that object.In web design this mostly refers to the size of button on a site. the site for tuts.com does a great job of this. Having 4 very large easy to access buttons
                at the top of thier page.

                The rule of thirds simply means to place a 3 x 3 grid over a picture and use this grid to ensure that there is proportion within the grid. This idea has been around since the 1700's nd is used so much people don't even realize that it is being used. One
                great website is Neve and Hawk web site, as you scroll through the site the rule of third changes it ratio' yet still does an amazing job of keeping visually pleasing.

            <p>
                Amazon uses the Hick's Law design principle by making their site very simple to use. With not a lot of choices at first for the user. This helps the user make a decision faster, and keeps them on the web site for longer has they explore their options.
