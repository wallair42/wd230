            <p>The last is Jeremy, looking for a small town that is cheap to live because the cost of housing in his town are way to high. Want to be within 2 hours of a major city, but can only afford housing that is less than what he gets from selling his home. Came across Olar as one of the smallest cities in South Carolina and is intrigue what resources business, and people are like in the town. May even consider opening a soda shop if the art tourism plan picks up.</p>
